# Twin-Systems Code Libaray

This is the official code library for:

"Explaining Deep Learning using examples: Optimal feature weighting methods for twin systems using post-hoc, explanation-by-example in XAI"

A PyTorch library available via "pip install" will be made available before December. 

Firstly, and explanation-by-example method will be available in the first version of the library.

Next, we will introduce the added ability to highlight key features used in the classification, and from where they arose in the training data.

We appreciate your patience, it should all be finished before December.
